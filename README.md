## FAQ
1. Can I modify and and distribute this program?
   * YES! I encourage anyone and everyone to modify this program and keep it up-to-date. 
2. Why does the program take a while to open? Is it Broken?
   * No, everything is working as intended. In order to prevent any installation the program is packaged in one small exe file. This file has to open up all the required bundled requirments and that can sometimes take a moment depending on your computer.
3. Why does windows say that it protectd my PC when I started the program?
   * Since I do not own a windows certification for this program, Microsoft Defenders SmartScreen does not recognize the application and prompts the user. In order to run the program all that needs to be done is select more info and click run anyway.
