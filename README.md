## FAQ
1. Can I modify and and distribute this program?
   * YES! I encourage anyone and everyone to modify this program and keep it up-to-date. 
2. Why does the program take a while to open? Is it Broken?
   * No, everything is working as intended. In order to prevent any installation the program is packaged in one small exe file. This file has to open up all the required bundled requirments and that can sometimes take a moment depending on your computer.
3. Why does windows say that it protectd my PC when I started the program?
   * Windows Defender's Smartscreen utilizes a reputation based app protection. Because this is a new program which doesn't have an existing security certifcation, windows will attempt to block it. In order to bypass this select more information and run anyway.
